# üìÑ Description

This project consists of two exercises focused on creating classes in Java that utilize generics and demonstrate method functionality. The exercises are as follows:

- **Exercise 1:** Implement a class called `NoGenericMethods` that stores three arguments of the same type, providing methods for storing and retrieving these objects, along with a constructor that allows for arguments to be passed in any order.
- **Exercise 2:** Create a `Person` class with attributes such as first name, last name, and age. Additionally, implement a class called `GenericMethods` with a generic method that accepts three arguments of any type and prints them, demonstrating the use of generics with different parameter types.
